# CKD-Prediction-Project
A machine learning model for predicting chronic kidney disease.     
This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using the powerful XGBoost machine learning algorithm, with its performance further optimized through hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.        
1. Introduction
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health concern affecting millions worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely intervention and treatment, which can help slow down disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Machine learning offers a promising approach for early detection by analyzing patient data and identifying patterns indicative of CKD.
